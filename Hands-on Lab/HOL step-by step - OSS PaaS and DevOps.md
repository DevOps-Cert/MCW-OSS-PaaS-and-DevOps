# OSS PaaS and DevOps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a solution for integrating and deploying complex Open Source Software (OSS) workloads into Azure PaaS. You will migrate an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application from a hosted environment into Azure Web App for Containers, migrate a MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB, enhance application functionality using serverless technologies, and fully embrace modern DevOps tools.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to migrate and deploy OSS applications into Azure PaaS using modern DevOps methodologies and Docker containers.

## Overview

Best For You Organics Company is one of the leading health food suppliers in North America, serving customers in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. They have a MERN stack web application which they host on-premises and are looking to migrate their OSS application into Azure. They will be creating a custom Docker image for their application and using Azure DevOps continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy the application into a Web App for Containers instance. In addition, they will be setting up Azure Cosmos DB, using the MongoDB APIs, so they do not have to make application code changes to leverage the power of Cosmos DB.

In this hands-on lab, you will assist with completing the OSS application and database migrations into Azure. You will create a custom Docker image, provision an Azure Container Registry, push the image to the registry, and configure the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application to a Web App for Containers instance.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This diagram consists of icons that are connected by arrows. On the left, the Developer icon (VS Code) points in a linear fashion to the GitHub Repo and Azure DevOps icons. The previous two icons are enclosed in a box labeled CI/CD Pipeline. Azure DevOps points to Web App for Containers on the right. Various arrows point from Web App for Container to: Azure Container Registry (a double-sided arrow); Logic Apps (a linear arrow that also points from Logic Apps to Customers); Customers (a linear arrow); and Azure Cosmos DB (a double-sided arrow that also points from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Functions with another double-sided arrow).](media/solution-architecture-diagram.png "Solution architecture diagram")

The solution begins with developers using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as their code editor, so they can leverage its rich integration with GitHub, Docker, and Azure. From a high level, developers will package the entire OSS application inside a custom Docker container using the Docker extension in VS Code. The image will be pushed to an Azure Container Registry as part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub and Azure DevOps. This Docker image will then be deployed to a Web App for Containers instance, as part of their continuous delivery process.

The MongoDB database will be imported into Azure Cosmos DB, using mongoimport.exe, and access the database from the application will continue to use the MongoDB APIs. The database connection string in the application will be updated to point to the new Cosmos DB.

Serverless architecture will be applied to order processing and customer notifications. Azure Functions will be used to automate the processing of orders. Logic Apps will be applied to send SMS notifications, via a Twilio connector, to customers informing them that their order has been processed and shipped.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN
    - Trial subscriptions will *not* work
2. Linux virtual machine configured with:
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Azure CLI
    - Docker
    - Node.js and npm
    - MongoDB Community Edition

## Exercise 1: Run starter application

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a local copy of the starter application on your Lab VM, add some sample data to the local MongoDB database, and run the application.

### Task 1: Connect to your Lab VM

In this task, you will create an RDP connection to your Lab VM. If you are already connected, skip to [Task 2](#task-2-grant-permissions-to-docker).

1. Navigate to the Azure portal and select **Resource groups** from the left-hand menu, then select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group** from the list. If there are too many, enter "hands-on-lab" into the filter box to reduce the resource groups displayed the list

1. On your Lab VM, open a bash shell.

2. At the command prompt, enter the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
    ```

3. After running the command, you will need **completely log out of the Lab VM** and log back in (if in doubt, reboot)

4. After logging back in, run the following command to test that the demouser account has proper permissions:

    ```sh
    docker run hello-world
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the bash shell command sudo usermod -a pG docker \$USER output. Includes output from running the test command, docker run hello-world.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image22.png "Bash Shell")

### Task 3: Integrate GitHub into VS Code

In this task, you will install the GitHub extension in VS Code, and configure a service integration with your GitHub account. This integration will allow you to push your code changes to GitHub directly from VS Code.

1. On your Lab VM, open **VS Code**

2. In VS Code, select the **Extensions** icon from the left-hand menu, enter "github" into the **Extensions** search box, and select the **GitHub** extension

6. Now, change the directory to the cloned project by entering the following at the prompt:

    ```sh
    cd mcw-oss-paas-devops
    ```

    ![The command to change the directory is displayed in the bash terminal window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image38.png "bash terminal window")

7. Finally, issue a command to open the starter project in VS Code by typing:

    ```sh
    code .
    ```

8. A new VS Code window will open, with the `mcw-oss-paas-devops` folder opened

    ![The MCW-OSS-PAAS-DEVOPS folder is open in the Explorer pane in the Visual Studio Code window, and the Welcome pane is open on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image39.png "Visual Studio Code window")

9. You are now ready to begin working with the project in VS Code

### Task 5: Launch the starter application

In this task, you will seed the MongoDB with sample data, then run the application locally, connected to your MongoDB instance. This task is to verify the connection to MongoDB and that it contains the seeded plan data, before we migrate the application and data to Azure Cosmos DB.

1. Return to VS Code, select **View** from the menu, and select **Integrated Terminal**

    ![Integrated Terminal is highlighted in the View menu (also highlighted) in Visual Studio Code.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image40.png "Visual Studio Code window")

2. This will open a new bash terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code dialog

3. At the bash prompt, use the `npm install` command to ensure the required components are installed on your Lab VM

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code dialog box. The command above is entered at the command prompt, and the results of the command are displayed.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image41.png "Bash terminal window")

4. Next, enter the following to seed the local MongoDB database with plans, user accounts, and orders

    ```sh
    node data/Seed.js
    ```

    ![The above command to seed the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image42.png "Bash terminal window")

    > Note: If you receive an error that the service is not running, start the MongoDB service by executing the `sudo service mongod start` command at the shell prompt.

5. Next, build the application using the following:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

6. Finally, enter the following to start the web server for the application

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

7. Open a browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000> to view the landing page of the starter application. You will see three plans listed on the application home page, which are pulled from the local MongoDB database.

    ![Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the application home page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image43.png "View the three plans")

8. Return to the VS Code integrated terminal window, and press **CTRL+C** to stop the application

## Exercise 2: Migrate the database to Cosmos DB

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will provision an Azure Cosmos DB account, and then update the starter application's database connection string to point to your new Azure Cosmos DB account. You will then, use `mongoimport.exe` to migrate the data in your MongoDB database into Cosmos DB collections, and verify with the application that you are connected to your Cosmos DB database.

### Task 1: Provision Cosmos DB using the MongoDB API

In this task, you will provision a new Azure Cosmos DB account using the MongoDB API.

1. In the Azure portal, select **+Create a resource**, **Databases**, the select **Azure Cosmos DB**

    ![+ Create a resource is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, and Databases and Azure Cosmos DB are highlighted on the New blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image44.png "Azure Portal")

2. On the **Azure Cosmos** **DB** blade, enter the following:

    - **ID**: Enter "best-for-you-db-SUFFIX," where SUFFIX is your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the name is unique (indicated by a green check mark)

    - **API:** Select **MongoDB**

    - **Subscription:** Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab

    - **Resource Group:** Select **Use existing** and choose the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group** you created previously

    - **Location:** Select a location near you from the list (Note: not all locations are available for Cosmos DB)

    - **Enable geo-redundancy:** Unchecked

    - Select **Create** to provision the new Azure Cosmos DB account

    ![The information above is entered in the Azure Cosmos DB blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image45.png "Azure Cosmos DB")

### Task 2: Update database connection string

In this task, you will retrieve the connection string for your Azure Cosmos DB database and update the starter application's database connection string.

1. When your Cosmos DB account is provisioned, navigate to it in the Azure portal

2. On the **Azure Cosmos DB account** blade, select **Connection String** under **SETTINGS** in the left-hand menu, and copy the **PRIMARY connection string**

    ![Connection String is selected under Settings on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade, and the Primary Connection String value is highlighted on the Read-write Keys tab on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image46.png "Azure cosmos DB account blade")

3. Return to VS Code

4. Open `app.js` from the root directory of the application and locate the line that starts with var **databaseUrl**

    ![App.js is selected and highlighted in the Explorer pane in the Visual Studio Code window, and the line starting with var databaseUrl is highlighted on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image47.png "Visual Studio Code window")

5. Replace the value of the **databaseUrl** variable with the Cosmos DB connection string you copied from the Azure portal

    ![The value of the databaseUrl variable is displayed in the Visual Studio Code window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image48.png "Visual Studio Code window")

6. Scroll to the end of the value you just pasted in and locate **10255/?ssl=** in the string

    ![10255/?ssl= is highlighted in the string in the Visual Studio Code window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image49.png "Visual Studio Code window")

7. Between the "/" and the "?" insert **best-for-you-organics** to specify the database name

    ![best-for-you-organics is selected in the string in the Visual Studio Code window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image50.png "Visual Studio Code window")

8. Save `app.js`

9. In the VS Code integrated terminal, enter the following command to rebuild the application

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

10. When the build completes, start the application by typing the following:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

11. Return to your browser and refresh the application page. Note: You may need to press **CTRL+F5** in your browser window to clear the browser cache while refreshing the page.

    ![This is a screenshot of the refreshed application page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image51.png "Refreshed application screenshot")

12. Notice the three plans that were displayed on the page previously are no longer there. This is because the application is now pointed to your Azure Cosmos DB, and there is no plan data in that database yet.

13. Let's move on to copying the data from the local MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB

### Task 3: Pre-create and scale collections

In this task, you will create the collections needed for your database migration and increase each collection's throughput from the default 1,000 RUs to 2,500 RUs. This is done to avoid throttling during the migration, and reduce the time required to import data.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB account, select **Browse** from the left-hand menu, under **COLLECTIONS**, and select **+Add Collection**

    ![Browse is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu of your Azure Cosmos DB account, and + Add Collection is highlighted on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image52.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

2. In the **Add Collection** dialog, enter the following:

    - **Database id:** Select **Create new**, and enter "best-for-you-organics"

    - **Collection Id:** Enter "orders"

    - **Storage capacity:** Select **Fixed (10 GB)**

    - **Throughput:** Enter "2500"

    - Select **OK** to create the collection

        ![The information above is entered in the Add Collection dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image53.png "Add Collection dialog box")

3. If they do not already exist, repeat steps 1 and 2 to create collections for:

    - users
    - plans

4. If the users and plans collections already exist from your application connecting, edit each collection to increase their throughput using the following steps

    - Expand the existing collection and select **Scale & Settings**

    - Enter "2500" into the **Throughput** box and select **Save**

    ![The turned delta next to users is highlighted under Collections, Scale & Settings is selected and highlighted below it, and Save is highlighted on the Scale & Settings tab on the right. 2500 is entered in the Throughput box on the Scale & Settings tab.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image54.png "Collections section")

### Task 4: Import data to the API for MongoDB using mongoimport

In this task, you will use `mongoimport.exe` to import data to your Cosmos DB account. There is a shell script located in the `mcw-oss-paas-devops` solution which handles exporting each collection to a JSON file.

1. Next, you will execute a script file, included in the project files you downloaded, to handle exporting the data out of your MongoDB into JSON files on the local file system. These files will be used for the import into Cosmos DB.

2. On your Lab VM, open a new integrated bash prompt in VS Code by selecting the **+** next to the shell dropdown in the integrated terminal pane

    ![This is a screenshot of the terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code dialog box. The + button is highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image55.png "Bash terminal window")

3. At the prompt, enter the following command to grant execute permissions on the export script:

    ```sh
    chmod +x ~/mcw-oss-paas-devops/data/mongo-export.sh
    ```

4. Next, run the script by entering the following command:

    ```sh
    ~/mcw-oss-paas-devops/data/mongo-export.sh
    ```

    ![The above command to export data from the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image56.png "Bash terminal window")

5. The script creates the folder ~/MongoExport, and exports each of the collections in your MongoDB to JSON files

6. You are now ready to import the data into Azure Cosmos DB using `mongoimport.exe`

7. Use the following command template for executing the data import:

    ```sh
    mongoimport --host <your_hostname>:10255 -u <your_username> -p <your_password> --db <your_database> --collection <your_collection> --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file ~/MongoExport/<your_collection>.json
    ```

8. To get the values needed for the template command above, return to the **Connection string** blade for your Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal. Leave this window up, as will need the **HOST, USERNAME**, and **PRIMARY PASSWORD** values from this page to import data to your Cosmos DB account.

    ![Connection String is selected under Settings on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Read-write Keys tab on the right, the values under Host, Username, and Primary Password are highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image57.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

9. Replace the values as follows in the template command above:

    - <your_hostname>: Copy and paste the **Host** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection String** blade
    - <your_username>: Copy and paste the **Username** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection String** blade
    - <your_password>: Copy and paste the **Primary Password** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection** **String** blade
    - <your_database>: Enter "best-for-you-organics"
    - <your_collection>: Enter "plans" (Note there are two instances of <your-collection> in the template command)

10. Your final command should look something like:

    ```sh
    mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection plans --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file ~/MongoExport/plans.json
    ```

11. Copy and paste the final command at the command prompt to import the plans collection into Azure Cosmos DB

    ![The final command to import the plans collection into Azure Cosmos DB is displayed in the Command Prompt window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image58.png "Bash terminal window")

12. You will see a message indicating the number of documents imported, which should be 3 for plans

13. Verify the import by selecting **Data Explorer** in your Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal, expanding plans, and selecting **Documents**. You will see the three documents imported listed.

    ![Data Explorer is selected and highlighted on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Collections blade, the turned delta next to plans is highlighted, and Documents is selected and highlighted below it. On the Mongo Documents tab to the right, the first of three imported documents is selected and highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image59.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

14. Repeat step 8 for the users and orders collections, replacing the **\<your\_collection\>** values with:

    - users

        ```sh
        mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection users --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file ~/MongoExport/users.json
        ```

    - orders

        ```sh
        mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection orders --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file ~/MongoExport/orders.json
        ```

15. To verify the starter application is now pulling properly from Azure Cosmos DB, return to your browser running the starter application (<http://localhost:3000>), and refresh the page. You should now see the three plans appear again on the home page. These were pulled from your Azure Cosmos DB database.

    ![Two Person Plan, High-Pro Plan, and Four Person Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the starter application.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image60.png "View the starter application")

16. You have successfully migrated the application and data to use Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB APIs

17. Return to the Integrated terminal window of VS Code which is running the application, and press **CTRL+C** to stop the application

### Task 5: Install Azure Cosmos DB extension for VS Code

In this task, you will install the Azure Cosmos DB extension for VS Code, to take advantage of the integration with Azure Cosmos DB. This extension allows you to view and interact with your Cosmos DB databases, collections, and documents directly from VS Code.
